Here write down the applicability of the software. For more information access the website: ???<http://www.bayz.biz/>???.

How to install
==============

Bayz can be used in two ways: on a unix/linux/windows prompt, or from R (available for Mac and Windows). Use from R is limited to some standard models and is now mostly suited for using smaller data sets. See the Bayz in R section. Use from a prompt is more versatile but requires writing a bayz script, examples are in the Bayz2.5 Examples section.
