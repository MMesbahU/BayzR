/********

 GenericPrior object holds 'generic' prior information from R bayzPrior object, and
 has methods to sample various types of parameters: samplevar (variance), samplefreq (frequency), ...
 There is now only one constructor that needs the model-term data-column, and extracts the
 prior information from it (if available).
 Every model-term has a GenericPrior member, and the modelTerm constructor also constructs
 GenericPrior with the data-column input.
 It is not necessary that a data-column has a prior, this can be OK if there is no prior needed
 or when a default can be used.
 Internal storage is quite similar as in the R bayzPrior object, with a list of the parameters
 and other settings of the prior, and a "dist" member (from the "dist" attribute in bayzPrior)
 that has a little text-string with the name of the distribution.
 The GenericPrior constructor checks if there is a "prior" attribute in the data-column, if
 it is of type bayzPrior and list, and if it has a "dist" attribute, and if all OK copies
 the list in 'members' and dist in 'dist'.
 A status is set in the GenericPrior:
   0 (OK)
   1: there was no prior (can be OK)
   2: there was a prior attribute in the data column, but it was not an R class bayzPrior and list
   3: the prior attribute did not have a "dist" attribute (wrongly built).
 Status >1 should be reason to terminate running, but I need to think how to report errors and quit.
 Throw?
