[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarniTausen/BayzR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarniTausen/BayzR)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MarniTausen/BayzR/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/MarniTausen/BayzR?branch=master)

Here write down the applicability of the software. For more information access the website: <http://www.bayz.biz/>.

How to install
==============

Bayz can be used in two ways: on a unix/linux/windows prompt, or from R (available for Mac and Windows). Use from R is limited to some standard models and is now mostly suited for using smaller data sets. See the Bayz in R section. Use from a prompt is more versatile but requires writing a bayz script, examples are in the Bayz2.5 Examples section.

To install this current development version, you first need to install devtools.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

To install the R package on your system you can then use:

``` r
devtools::install_github("MarniTausen/BayzR")
```
